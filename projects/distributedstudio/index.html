<p><strong><em>How do we make a class full of remote students feel like they are working in a studio environment, collaborating on a software design journey together?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ongoing research since 2011</li>
<li>OLT grant for 2016 (to look at the student experience doing a critique process over asynchronous video)</li>
</ul>

<p>Back in 2011, while I was working at NICTA, Jörn Guy Süß and I designed a software studio course for UQ where we put the whole class working on one project. It was a &ldquo;supercollaborative&rdquo; course, as we had teams working on each feature, but because they worked on a common project the teams had to collaborate with each other. In 2012, I coordinated the course and refined it, together with Jim Steel. The following two years, Jim and I co-taught it as DECO2800 with Jim coordinating &ndash; in 2014 we had 200 students on the same project, which we believe is still a record.</p>

<p>In 2015, I moved to UNE, where the vast majority of our students are remote. I&rsquo;m quite keen on studio teaching &ndash; it makes &ldquo;I see what you did there&rdquo; moments happen, and students can learn from each others&rsquo; experiences not just their own. So, at UNE I created perhaps one of the first <em>distributed</em> studio courses, and we had students from all over Australia, and even Hong Kong, working on a project together.</p>

<p>David Waugh put together a little a couple of little videos about it for our YouTube stream&hellip;</p>

<p><em>(Note, the screenshots aren&rsquo;t from the student code &ndash; David grabbed some slides from an early lecture where I was encouraging students to think about the wide variety of game styles and mechanics they could be inspired by.)</em></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EO9NSg_yL5A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>As the students are never in the same room together, we are very reliant on CSCW systems &ndash; both real-world ones (GitHub, Slack, etc) and custom ones I&rsquo;ve created (Assessory so students can critique each other over video, and soon a project status dashboard). As Australia&rsquo;s only <em>distributed</em> studio development course, there&rsquo;s rather a lot of research and work to do in it.</p>

<p>The UNE version actually has slightly more content in it (at least compared to last time I taught the UQ version). That&rsquo;s an interesting effect of having two mostly-online lectures per week versus one two-hour in-person session at UQ &ndash; there is suddenly quite a noticeable demarkation between the content delivery and the studio practice.</p>

<p>Projects we had the students working on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>2011 UQ - <em>RoboCode</em> (using the open source code as a base) &ndash; we gave a set of 30 different overlapping ways to change the game, and a continuous integration environment so the teams&rsquo; code would have to work together</p></li>

<li><p>2012 UQ - <em>RoboCode</em> (again) &ndash; this year we threw it over to students to decide how to change the game; one group turned it into robot soccer, and another added Call of Duty killstreaks &hellip; This iteration was mostly about improving the student experience (replacing things that didn&rsquo;t work), making the inter-team collaboration start earlier (at feature design rather than only after coding has begun), and adding a demo day and portfolios to give the students a clear view of how they&rsquo;d be assessed</p></li>

<li><p>2013 UQ - <em>DECO Arcade</em> &ndash; A Steam-like game arcade. Jim had the very good idea of giving students a smaller starter code-base, so they could own the architectural design as well as the features. (It turns out if you give students a large code base, they knit their code into it rather than making structural changes or refactoring). We also added a critique process, which I built into Assessory (over about four days), partly inspired by <em>Exegesis</em>, an online &ldquo;write, submit, then critique others&rdquo; exercise Harriet Truscott had built in Cambridge for students of Shakespearian literature.</p></li>

<li><p>2014 UQ - <em>Decoworld</em> &ndash; I wrote the starter for this one, but the to be fair the mission was Jim&rsquo;s idea &ndash; DECO Arcade had been a too fragmented &ndash; different teams doing different games, and sharing a few &ldquo;hub&rdquo; features. So let&rsquo;s make it a single open world game so that the features will need to play with each other more.</p></li>

<li><p>2015 UNE - <em>Decoworld</em> &ndash; as I&rsquo;d written the starter code for Decoworld, I re-used the same starter code at UNE as a way of comparing the UQ on-campus and UNE off-campus dynamics. Would studio work with off-campus students? This was also the first year I added Slack. (And it turned out Jim did at UQ too &ndash; we shared materials, including me recording UQ&rsquo;s exam practice tutorial video)</p></li>

<li><p>2016 UNE &ndash; <em>Sense-O-Matic</em> &ndash; We&rsquo;re quite big on data science at UNE, so this year the students will be building a real-time data processing and visualisation platform (using Akka and JavaFX).</p></li>

<li><p>2017 UNE &ndash; <em>Leaders</em> &ndash; An empire-building game where the AI works for you. Partly inspired by playing too much <em>Civilization</em>&hellip;</p></li>
